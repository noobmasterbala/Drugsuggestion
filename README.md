# Drug suggestion using Datastructures
This project was done to demonstrate my skills in data structures (Trees and Dynamic linked lists) and C++. The project can suggest drugs to the user based on his/her symptoms.  The program also has a database which checks keeps track of the available drugs and their supply. The database can be updated. The program will suggest the apt drug needed based on the symptoms and inventory.

Please run main.c to see the complete project.
